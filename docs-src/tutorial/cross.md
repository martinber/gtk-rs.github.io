# Preparing rust

First install rust normally with rustup. The next step will install the windows toolchain.

    rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu

Then set up the target in `~/.cargo/config`.

    [target.x86_64-pc-windows-gnu]
    linker = "x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc"
    ar = "x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc-ar"

## Mingw and gtk Installation

### Arch Linux

The mingw packages are in the AUR, you can either install manually or use a helper. These instructions use the pacaur helper. The packages take a while to compile.

    pacaur -S mingw-w64-gcc mingw-w64-freetype2-bootstrap mingw-w64-cairo-bootstrap
    pacaur -S mingw-w64-harfbuzz
    pacaur -S mingw-w64-pango
    pacaur -S mingw-w64-poppler
    pacaur -S mingw-w64-gtk3

### Ubuntu and other distributions

If you can't find gtk precompiled dll, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the 64 bit version of the latest precompiled gtk libraries from [here](http://win32builder.gnome.org/).
2. Unzip it in a folder. For example, to install it in `/opt/gtkwin`: `mkdir /opt/gtkwin;unzip <file.zip> -d /opt/gtkwin`.
3. You have to set-up the library to match the installation folder:

```    
cd /opt/gtkwin
find -name '*.pc' | while read pc; do sed -e "s@^prefix=.*@prefix=$PWD@" -i "$pc"; done
```

## Compiling

Now create your project using gtk-rs (and relm, it's great). if you don't want a terminal window to pop up when running add the following to the top of your main.rs.

    #![windows_subsystem = "windows"]

Once you get it working on linux you can compile for windows following these steps.

    export PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_CROSS=1
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/i686-w64-mingw32/lib/pkgconfig
    cargo build --target=x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --release

For other distributions than Arch Linux you should `export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/gtkwin/lib/pkgconfig` or wherever you installed the precompiled binaries.


If you have some problems while compiling, you might want to consider rebooting since this has solved some problem on my side.
Also, you should be careful when using Glade with gtk-rs. Make sure that the version requested by Glade is at most equal to the version installed on your system. Otherwise it will fail to execute.

## Packaging

First we setup a variable to specify the installation path of Gtk. If you installed the binaries in a specific folder, you should specify it. For example if you followed this guide for Ubuntu and other distributions, you should change it to `/opt/gtkwin`.

    GTK_INSTALL_PATH=/usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32
    
Lastly to package it up.

    mkdir /wherever/release
    cp target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/release/*.exe /wherever/release
    cp $GTK_INSTALL_PATH/bin/*.dll /wherever/release
    mkdir -p /wherever/release/share/glib-2.0/schemas
    mkdir /wherever/release/share/icons
    cp $GTK_INSTALL_PATH/share/glib-2.0/schemas/* /wherever/release/share/glib-2.0/schemas
    cp -r $GTK_INSTALL_PATH/share/icons/* /wherever/release/share/icons

After that you can zip up the contents of the /wherever/release folder and distribute it.

## Optional Extras

### Icon and version info

These steps are for adding an icon to your program. First make a rc file showing where the icon is and the version info. Change "path/to/my.ico" to your icon". The BLOCK "040904E4" and VALUE "Translation", 0x409, 1252 are for US english, if you would like something different refer to https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa381058

src/program.rc:

    id ICON "path/to/my.ico"
    1 VERSIONINFO
    FILEVERSION     1,0,0,0
    PRODUCTVERSION  1,0,0,0
    BEGIN
    BLOCK "StringFileInfo"
    BEGIN
        BLOCK "040904E4"
        BEGIN
            VALUE "CompanyName", "My Company Name"
            VALUE "FileDescription", "My excellent application"
            VALUE "FileVersion", "1.0"
            VALUE "InternalName", "my_app"
            VALUE "LegalCopyright", "My Name"
            VALUE "OriginalFilename", "my_app.exe"
            VALUE "ProductName", "My App"
            VALUE "ProductVersion", "1.0"
        END
    END
    BLOCK "VarFileInfo"
    BEGIN
        VALUE "Translation", 0x409, 1252
    END
    END

now to have the linker include it you'll need to make a build script, first add the following to your Cargo.toml:

    [package]
    build = "build.rs"

then in your build.rs

    use std::process::Command;
    use std::env;
    use std::path::Path;

    fn main() {
        let out_dir = env::var("OUT_DIR").unwrap();
        Command::new("x86_64-w64-mingw32-windres")
            .args(&["src/program.rc"])
            .arg(&format!("{}/program.o", out_dir))
            .status().unwrap();
        
        Command::new("x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc-ar")
            .args(&["crus", "libprogram.a", "program.o"])
            .current_dir(&Path::new(&out_dir))
            .status().unwrap();

        println!("cargo:rustc-link-search=native={}", out_dir);
        println!("cargo:rustc-link-lib=static=program");
    }

You'll need to comment out both prints when building for linux.

### Windows 10 theme

If you'd like the program to have a more native look you can set the theme to windows 10.

    mkdir /wherever/release/share/themes
    mkdir /wherever/release/share/gtk-3.0

edit /wherever/release/share/gtk-3.0/settings.ini

    [Settings]
    gtk-theme-name = Windows10
    gtk-font-name = Segoe UI 10
    gtk-xft-rgba = rgb

then download the windows 10 them from http://b00merang.weebly.com/windows-10.html.

    unzip Windows-10-master.zip
    mv Windows-10-master /wherever/release/share/themes/Windows10
