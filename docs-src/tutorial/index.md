# Tutorial

## Introduction

Here's an introduction to `Gtk-rs` crates. For the users who already know Rust and Gtk, just skip this part.

 * [Rust and `Gtk-rs`](./rust_and_gtk): This part explains how to add dependencies on the `Gtk-rs` crates, depending on your needs.
 * [Gnome libraries and Rust](./gnome_and_rust): This part explains a bit how the bindings of the Gnome libraries work in Rust.

## Full usage of `Gtk-rs` crates

In this part we'll go deeper into the mechanisms of the `Gtk-rs` crates. If you're not sure about your Rust or Gnome libraries knowledge, we recommend you to take a look at the previous tutorials first.

 * [Specifying version](./version).
 * [Callbacks and closures](./closures).
 * [Upcast and downcast](./upcast_downcast).
 * [Glade](./glade).
 * [Cross compiling from linux to windows](./cross).

## Going further

Make sure to check the [examples repository](https://github.com/gtk-rs/examples). Also you can take a look at the source code of [projects using `gtk-rs`](/#projects-using-gtk-rs).
